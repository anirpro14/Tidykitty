/*
  # Create TidyKitty Database Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `families` - Family groups with invite codes
    - `users` - Both parents and children with authentication
    - `tasks` - Chores assigned to family members
    - `rewards` - Rewards that can be redeemed with points
    - `task_suggestions` - Task suggestions from children to parents

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for family-based access control
    - Users can only access data from their own family

  3. Features
    - User authentication with Supabase Auth
    - Family invite system with codes
    - Point tracking and leveling system
    - Task completion and reward redemption
